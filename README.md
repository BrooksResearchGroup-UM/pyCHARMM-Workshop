# pyCHARMM Workshop

Date: June 20-24, 2022

Time: 4:00 - 5:30 PM EDT

Location: Chem 1706

## Preliminaries

For those who do not have access to *gollum* or would like to set up their own conda environment for pycharmm, clone this repo and create the conda environment by

```shell
cd pyCHARMM-Workshop/
conda create -n pyCHARMM -c conda-forge -c schrodinger \
pymol rdkit jupyterlab openbabel openmm
conda activate pyCHARMM
```

We will utilize pyCHARMM from the current developers stream. If you are working on *gollum* you can link to the pyCHARMM version I compiled using (tsch):

```shell
export CHARMM_HOME=/home/brookscl/charmm/c47-dev-release/
export CHARMM_LIB_DIR=$CHARMM_HOME/install-pycharmm-nompi/lib
```

Install pyCHARMM in the conda environment using pip

```shell
pip install $CHARMM_HOME/tool/pycharmm
```

## Building pyCHARMM

If you are building pyCHARMM in your local environment (assuming Linux, gcc (I use v7.3), NVIDIA drivers (I use cuda v10.0)/gpu access with OpenMM already installed), in the **CHARMM directory**:

```shell
mkdir -p build_charmm; cd build_charmm
../configure --with-blade --with-fftdock --without-mpi \
--as-library -p ../install-pycharmm-nompi
make -j 2 -C install
```

Following this you will need to set the environment variable `CHARMM_LIB_DIR` as noted above to point to your install library directory, and install the pyCHARMM modules using pip.

```shell
pip install ../tool/pycharmm
export CHARMM_LIB_DIR=/path/to/charmm_dir/install-pycharmm-nompi/lib
```

## Required modules/codes:

1. [**MMTSB Toolset**](https://github.com/mmtsb/toolset) is utilized and should be installed .
2. [**propKa**](https://github.com/jensengroup/propka) will be utilized.
3. [**pymol**](https://pymol.org/2/) will be utilzied locally to view structures.

## Using jupyter-lab locally

If you have pycharmm installed locally in the `pyCHARMM` virtual environment, you can start a jupyter-lab by typing `jupyter lab` in the same conda environment.
