"msld_py_prep" = a suite of python scripts to automate MSLD ligand file preparation
===================================================================================

== (01/01/2022) == J. Vilseck & L. Cervantes

System Requirements:
 - msld_py_prep needs python, numpy, and pandas (or alternatively Anaconda)
 - Lg_Solvate.sh needs convpdb.pl from the MMTSB toolset (https://github.com/mmtsb/toolset)
 - vis_check.py uses PyMOL 

What's Needed:
 - a mol2 file and rtf/prm (or cgenff str) toppar files for every ligand you want to study with MSLD
 - edit "msld_py_prep.py" with information about the current series of ligands
 - update "mol_list.txt" with mol2 filenames (without the .mol2 suffix)


What's Done:
 (1) A "Maximum Common Substructure"-like search is performed to identify common cores & 
     alchemical fragment atoms in each molecule
 (2) Each Molecule is then divided up into core + fragment(s) and each component is subjected to
     Charge Renormalization to make MSLD suitable rtf file
 (3) Then pdb, rtf, and prm files are printed
 (4) Finally, charmm scripts are printed (these work with the current verions of ALF)


A few notes of interest:
- LP (lonepair) sites should be accepted and handled appropriately
- Lg_Solvate.sh is not automatically called by msld_py_prep.py
- Lg_Solvate.sh requires up-to-date CHARMM toppar files in a directory called "toppar"
